# TCP-Socket-programming
A simple multithreaded client-server communication via TCP. The code does the following:
  1. Fibonnaci
  2. Sort
  3. Generate random number
  4. Exit

The command is sent from the client to the server. All the calculations are done at the server side and sends the result back to the client via the socket.

To compile the program: 
```make all```

To compile either the client.c or server.c :
```make client.c```
or
```make server.c```
